# LinguaQuest Architecture Refactor

## Overview
This refactor separates routing concerns from the game dashboard logic to create a cleaner, more maintainable architecture.

## What Changed

### Before (Monolithic Structure)
- **App.tsx**: Single large component containing:
  - All routing logic (Routes, onboarding flow, etc.)
  - Game dashboard interface
  - Game state management
  - Component imports

### After (Separated Concerns)

#### 1. **RootPage.tsx** (`/src/pages/RootPage.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Handle ALL routing logic
- **Contains**:
  - React Router Routes configuration
  - Login page, onboarding flow, settings
  - Navigation between different sections
  - User authentication checks

#### 2. **Dashboard.tsx** (`/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Pure game dashboard interface
- **Contains**:
  - Game state management
  - Scenario, timer, progress tracking
  - Argument input and evaluation
  - Game UI components

#### 3. **App.tsx** (`/src/App.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Simple compatibility redirect
- **Contains**: Just a redirect to "/" for any legacy imports

## File Structure

```
src/
├── App.tsx                    # Simple redirect (compatibility)
├── App_backup.tsx            # Original monolithic version (preserved)
├── index.tsx                 # Updated to use RootPage
├── pages/
│   └── RootPage.tsx          # All routing logic
└── components/
    └── Dashboard.tsx         # Pure game dashboard
```

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Routing logic is separate from game logic
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify either routing or game features independently
3. **Reusability**: Dashboard can be used in different routing contexts
4. **Clarity**: Each file has a single, clear responsibility

## Navigation Flow

1. User visits any URL → **RootPage.tsx** handles routing
2. `/app` route → Renders **Dashboard.tsx** component
3. Dashboard focuses purely on game interface, no routing concerns

## Backward Compatibility

- Original App.tsx preserved as App_backup.tsx
- New App.tsx provides redirect for any legacy imports
- All existing functionality maintained
